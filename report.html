<h1>Project 1: Static Site | Report</h1>

<p>
  Below of listed the task goals & how I completed them:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>You will create a website with a focused theme and audience of your choosing.</b>
      This project has a specific focus catered to winter snow sport enthusists and the casual activity audience. 
      The website serves a (pretend) business.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites.</b>
      All content I've either made or referenced in a way making it my own. I've listed <a href="#sources">sources</a> that I've referenced
      during the project towards the bottom of the page. Images used pertain to the Creative Commons license. I also wanted to note I am quite
      proud of the callendar I made on <a href="book.html">book.html</a>. This spent quite a bit of time and many of the ideas I had for this were mostly my own
      thoughts in recreating a calendar.
