  <h1>Project 1: Static Site | Report</h1>

  <p>
    Below of listed the task goals & how I completed them:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>You will create a website with a focused theme and audience of your choosing.</b>
      This project has a specific focus catered to winter snow sport enthusists and the casual activity audience.
      The website serves a (pretend) business.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites.</b>
      All content I've either made or referenced in a way making it my own. I've listed <a href="#sources">sources</a>
      that I've referenced
      during the project towards the bottom of the page. Images used pertain to the Creative Commons license. I also
      wanted to note I am quite
      proud of the callendar I made on <a href="book.html">book.html</a>. This spent quite a bit of time and many of the
      ideas I had for this were mostly my own
      thoughts in recreating a calendar.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should
        be named index.html.</b>
      The site contains more than five pages and one named <a href="index.html">index.html</a>. An example of five pages
      to check out include:
      <ol>
        <li><a href="about.html">ABOUT (about.html)</a></li>
        <li><a href="activities.html">SEASONAL ACTIVITIES (activities.html)</a></li>
        <li><a href="slopes.html">SLOPES (slopes.html)</a></li>
        <li><a href="book.html">BOOK A TRIP (book.html)</a></li>
        <li><a href="contact.html">CONTACT US (contact.html)</a></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your site must include some sort of header.</b>
      The site includes the navbar as the header. It includes a logo for the business, temperature of the mountain, as
      well as navigation to the
      bigger category pages of the site.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.</b>
      As discussed in the previous question, the header includes a navbar, which includes navigation to some of the
      bigger category pages of
      the site. These pages list more broad scope information, while pages which can be navigated to further on these
      broader scoped pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries.</b>
      The site overall is a reponsive site, and supports large and small screens. When the screen size is less than 768
      pixels the navbar will
      transform. To open the navigation menu, the hamburger shaped button can be selected, and a vertical menu will
      appear. Otherwise when the
      screen is larger, the menu items will be layed out horizontally at the top of the screen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages.</b>
      The site's style is layed out in a css stylesheet labeled as <i>css/style.css</i>. All pages import this style in
      it's initial head
      declaration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of
        screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.</b>
      I tried my best to make this site accesible. Images are displayed across pages with their own corresponding
      <i>alt</i> attribute.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Each page must declare its favicon.</b>
      In the head declaration, a favicon is included with the site's simple logo.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. </b>
      Directories were created for images, CSS, and JavaScript code as specified.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks.</b>
      The site was completely made with base HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No libraries or frameworks were used.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s Nu             <!-- CHECK THIS AGAIN ****************** -->
        Validator.</b> 
      According to W3C's Nu Validator there were a few errors & warnings scattered throughout.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>The content should be neatly aligned and axes of alignment should be clearly visible.</b>
      In general pages, are left-aligned. Most items that look to be centered are left-aligned, but adjusted to look
      centered. Occasionally there are some centered items with a weak center-aligned.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>The content should have adequate and consistent spacing.</b>
      Text is padded inside containers and negative space is used around the borders. For a stylistic affect, some
      images hang outside the containers.
    <li>
      <b>Your site must use at least two different font faces.</b>
      The headings for pages were given a sans-serif font, and the paragraphs are in a serif font. More specifically the
      headings are a
      "Cambria"/"Times New Roman" font and the paragraph text is a "Franklin Gothic Medium"/"Arial" typeface.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Your site must include at least one form.</b>
      The site includes a form survey on the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>, which doesn't do anything at this
      point. It contains form elements like input boxes, a slider, and submit button.
    </li>
  </ol>
